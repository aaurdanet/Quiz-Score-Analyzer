Quiz Score Analyzer 
Overview

The Quiz Score Analyzer program is designed to analyze the quiz scores of a group of students. It calculates and displays both the average score for each student across all quizzes and the average score for each quiz across all students.
Code Structure

The code is written in C and uses a two-dimensional array to store quiz scores for multiple students. It then iterates through the array to calculate and print the average scores.
Features

    Student Averages:
        Calculates and prints the average score for each student across all quizzes.

    Quiz Averages:
        Calculates and prints the average score for each quiz across all students.

Constants

    STUDENTS: Represents the number of students in the dataset (set to 4 in this example).
    QUIZZES: Represents the number of quizzes each student has taken (set to 5 in this example).

Usage

    The program is configured with pre-defined quiz scores for each student.
    It calculates and prints the average score for each student and each quiz.
    The results are displayed with two decimal places for better precision.

Known Limitations

    The program currently uses fixed quiz scores, and any changes to the dataset would require modifications in the source code.

Future Enhancements

    Allow dynamic input for quiz scores to make the program more versatile.
    Implement additional statistical analysis features, such as standard deviation.
